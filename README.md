# Custom-Hash-Table Project

## Introduction

The Custom-Hash-Table project is a C++ implementation designed to solve the Greatest Sum Problem using a custom hash table. This project comprises two main files: `GreatestSumHash.cpp` and `myHash.h`. The `myHash.h` file contains the template class for the custom hash table implementation, while `GreatestSumHash.cpp` utilizes this custom hash table to find the greatest sum of three distinct elements in an array that sums up to the greatest element in that array.

## The Greatest Sum Problem

The Greatest Sum Problem involves finding the highest possible sum of three distinct numbers within an array, where the sum also exists as an element within the same array. This problem showcases the use of hash tables for efficient data storage and retrieval, optimizing the search process for the required sum combination.
